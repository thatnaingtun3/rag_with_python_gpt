how to manage and set up the canteen menu within the SFU Learn system. Below is a breakdown of the key points:
1. Setting Up the Canteen Menu:
    • The canteen menu must be set up and managed through the SFU Learn Backend System.
    • A category for the canteen menu must be created first. This helps organize menu items based on their type (e.g., "Everyday", "Pre-order").
    • For each category, the admin must ensure it is set up correctly for visibility, and items within the category can be activated or deactivated.
2. Adding Menu Categories:
    • To add a new menu category:
        ◦ The admin needs to enter a category name and assign a rank (which determines its position in the menu).
        ◦ The category can be activated or deactivated based on its availability.
3. Adding Menu Items:
    • After setting up the category, the admin can proceed to add individual menu items.
        ◦ For each menu item, the following details must be filled out:
            ▪ Name: The name of the item.
            ▪ Price: The cost of the item.
            ▪ Rank: The rank or position of the item in the menu.

        ◦ Pre-order: If the item is available for pre-order, this option should be selected.
4. Menu Visibility and Management:
    • Menu items and categories can be set to inactive if they are not available at the moment. When an item or category is inactive, it will not appear on the users' menus.
    • The admin can also manage the visibility of the menu based on the time of day (e.g., if it's available only during certain hours or days).
    • Each menu item can be edited as needed to adjust prices, descriptions, or status.
5. Saving Changes:
    • After creating or editing a category or item, the admin should press the Save button to finalize the changes and ensure the updates reflect in the canteen system.
